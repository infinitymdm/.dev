In this first entry in the [Laymanized]({{< ref "/categories/laymanized" >}}) series, we'll take a
look at my first publication and dive into the topic of standard cell characterization.

<!--more-->

This entry is broken up into three parts.
- In the [first part](/background), we'll go over background information you'll need in order to
understand the paper.
- In the next part (coming soon), we'll look at how CharLib works under the hood.
- In the third and final part (coming a little less soon), we'll compare CharLib to other standard
cell characterization tools, and discuss future goals for the project.

CharLib is an open source project and can be found [here on GitHub](https://github.com/stineje/charlib).
I wrote it over the course of about a year, building on ideas from several existing works and with
lots of input from my advisor, Dr. James Stine.

You can find the paper in the proceedings of the 2024 IEEE Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems.

> At the time of writing, the publication is not yet publicly available. I'll update this soon with
a link.
