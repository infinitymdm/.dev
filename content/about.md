## Who are you?

I'm Marcus Mellor. I'm currently a Ph. D. student and researcher at Oklahoma State University
studying computer arithmetic. My previous work was as a test engineer at a large government
contractor, where I designed tools to help people make better hardware. Before that, I studied
electrical engineering at Oklahoma Christian University.

My goal is to make electrical and computer engineering more accessible to everyone. I'm a believer
in the power of open source and open hardware efforts; you'll see me talk about those pretty often.
I'm a chronic tinkerer and a Linux enthusiast, though I admit I only know enough to be a danger to
my own computers. My hobbies include playing video games with my friends, reading (especially
science fiction), and using tools on things (hopefully constructively).

### Fun Facts about Me

- I have spent more money on Lego sets than I care to admit
- I was once hospitalized in a game of Duck Duck Goose
- My favorite video game series is Xenoblade Chronicles
- I can fit 18 grapes in my mouth at once

## What is this website?

This website is mostly a place for me to talk about work I'm doing or cool stuff others have done.
